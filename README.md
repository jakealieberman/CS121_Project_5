# CS121_Project_5

## Algorithm
* Input
  * Two integers
  * One string format
* Goal
  * Add the two integers
  * Print the string that many times
* Step by step
  * 1
    * Open the file using fstream
  * 2
    * Read a full line into line
    * Initialize stringstream
    * use getLine to get the first number as a string
    * use getLine to get the second number as a string
    * use getLine to get the third number as a string
    * Convert str1 to num1
    * Convert str2 to num2
    * Compute sum = num1 + num2
    * Use a for loop from 0 to sum - 1
      * print text followed by a space
    * print a newline after each lines output
  * 3
    * Close the file
* Example Output
  * this this this 
  * is is is is is is 
  * a a a a a a a a a 
  * lot lot lot lot lot lot
  * of of of 
  * fun fun fun fun fun fun
